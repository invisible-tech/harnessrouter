#   agent   the product: the gateway, the console, the data volume. Its databases, blobs and
#           secret store are readable by it alone.
#   20000+  one uid per session, owning its session directory and nothing else. It cannot read or
#           write another session's workspace, the workspace parent, the databases, the blobs or
#           the secret store: a deliverable written to any of those paths fails at the write, while
#           the model is still there to choose the right one, instead of vanishing. Shared scratch
#           (/tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm) stays writable, because tools hardcode it — see the mode
