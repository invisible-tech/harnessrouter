# Community Edition setup and operations

Detailed installation, configuration, API, and deployment instructions. For the shorter five-step path, start with the [README quickstart](../README.md#quickstart). This guide retains separate image-pull and container-start steps, so its installation sequence has six steps.

## Install

Six steps, and at the end of them you have a running instance, a signed-in console, and an agent
that has answered you.

You need Docker, about 4 GB of disk, and an API key from a model provider. There is no account to
create and nothing to sign up for. The provider key is the only credential in the story, and it
never leaves the box except to call the provider it belongs to.

### 1. Pull the image

```bash
docker pull harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

About 700 MB to download.

<details>
<summary>Pinning a version instead of <code>latest</code></summary>

`latest` is the current release, and pulling it again is how you upgrade. Pin a version only when
you need two machines to run the same bytes, by naming a version in a compose file you share with a
team. Releases are listed on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessrouter/harnessrouter/tags).

</details>

### 2. Run it

Copy this as it is. Nothing in it is a placeholder — no provider key, no password.

```bash
docker run -d --name harnessrouter \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -v harnessrouter:/data \
  harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

If port 3000 is already busy, change only the left-hand number (`-p 127.0.0.1:3100:3000`), because
the container always listens on 3000 inside.

<details>
<summary>What each part of that line does</summary>

`-p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000` keeps the console reachable only from this machine. That is what makes it
safe to start on a default login and change it afterwards.

`-v harnessrouter:/data` is where everything durable lives: the database, your files, and the agent
CLIs installed on the first start. Keeping that volume is what makes every later start fast.

No provider key, because you connect a provider from the console in step 5. That is the shorter
road: a key pasted into a form cannot be misspelled into a shell history, and changing it later does
not mean recreating the container.

No password, because the instance starts on a default login that step 4 gives you and asks you to
change.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do not add <code>--user</code>: the container starts as root and drops privileges itself</summary>

The container must start as root, and from 0.8.2 it refuses to start any other way, with one line
saying so. This is not the usual "runs as root" shortcut; it is the opposite. Root is needed for
exactly one thing: every agent CLI runs as its own per-session user, which owns that session's
workspace and nothing else. Switching to that user is what root is for, and the product itself runs
as an unprivileged user from the first second.

What that buys you, inside one container serving many sessions:

- An agent cannot read or write another session's files, the databases, the blob store or the
  secret store. Not "is told not to": cannot, because those paths belong to other users.
- A file an agent saves to the wrong place fails at the write, while the model is still there to
  correct itself, instead of silently disappearing outside the collected workspace.
- An agent process carries none of the product's secrets in its environment.

No extra privilege is granted to get there: no `--privileged`, no `--cap-add`, no custom seccomp
profile. Docker's default capability set already includes what a root process needs to switch to
another user, and that is all that is used.

If you run with `--user` today (or `user:` in a compose file), remove it before upgrading. The
documented command above never set one, and a volume from any earlier version is adopted in place
on the first start.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Choosing your own username and password at <code>docker run</code></summary>

Two optional variables. Set them and they replace the defaults; the console never shows you the
default login again.

```bash
docker run -d --name harnessrouter \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -v harnessrouter:/data \
  -e HR_AUTH_USER=you \
  -e HR_AUTH_PASSWORD=the-password-you-chose \
  harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

Whatever you put after `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD=` **is** the password — sign in with exactly that in step
4. You do not need this to get started, and changing the password from the profile page later works
just as well; it exists for a box built by a script, where nobody is going to open a browser.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using Docker Compose instead</summary>

`cp .env.example .env`, then `docker compose up -d`. Read `docker-compose.yml` first: it publishes
`3000:3000` on every interface rather than on loopback. Change that one line and it behaves like the
command above.

</details>

### 3. Wait for it to say it is ready

**Do not open the browser yet.** `docker run` gives your prompt back in about a second, but the
console needs roughly another half a minute, and until then <http://localhost:3000> refuses the
connection. That is the first start still working, not a broken container.

```bash
docker logs -f harnessrouter
```

Wait for `ready on :3000`, then open the browser:

```
[harnessrouter] installing Claude Code (Anthropic's terms apply)…
[harnessrouter] installing opencode (MIT)…
[harnessrouter] installing Qwen Code (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Gemini CLI (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Cline (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Codex (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Pi (MIT) and its MCP adapter (MIT)…
[harnessrouter] installing Oh My Pi (MIT)…
[harnessrouter] installing DeepSeek Harness (MIT, developer preview — version-pinned)…
[harnessrouter] installing Hermes (check its upstream license before use)…
[harnessrouter] data=/data  backends available: claude codex hermes pi dsh opencode qwen gemini cline omp mini-swe-agent
[harnessrouter] ready on :3000
```

This wait happens once per volume. Every start after it takes a few seconds and prints no install
lines at all.

<details>
<summary>The other lines, and why the first start is the slow one</summary>

`backends available:` lists what actually installed, so a backend that failed is named rather than
silently missing, and the others still work.

You will also see this line, and it comes back on every start until you change the password in step
4. On a loopback-only instance it is a reminder rather than a problem:

```
[harnessrouter] WARNING: using the DEFAULT password. Set HR_AUTH_PASSWORD, or change it from the profile page, before exposing this instance.
```

The agent CLIs are fetched on the first start rather than shipped in the image, and that is a
licensing fact rather than a packaging preference. Claude Code is distributed under Anthropic's own
terms and hermes-agent declares no license at all, so neither can be redistributed inside a public
image. Installing them on first run means you install them yourself, from upstream, under those
terms, which is also why you should read them before you use those two backends. The rest arrive
the same way and under their own terms: Codex, Qwen Code, Gemini CLI and Cline (Apache-2.0),
opencode and Pi (MIT, Pi with its MIT-licensed MCP adapter), Oh My Pi (MIT, a prebuilt binary
pinned to a release and checked against the publisher's SHA256SUMS before it is installed) and
DeepSeek Harness (MIT, a developer preview pinned to an exact version). mini-SWE-agent (MIT) is
not on this list because it never was one of the ten fetched at first start: it is a pure-Python
pip dependency pinned in `runner/requirements.txt`, so it ships already installed in the image
like FastAPI or pydantic — no separate license-gated fetch, no line in this log.

</details>

### 4. Sign in

Open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in with:

| | |
|---|---|
| Username | `harnessrouter` |
| Password | `harnessrouter` |

![The sign-in screen](images/01-login.png)

**Change the password now**, from **Profile** in the account menu at the top right. Saving restarts
the console, which takes about a second.

If you set `HR_AUTH_USER` or `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD` at `docker run`, sign in with those instead — the
defaults are then refused.

<details>
<summary>Where the password lives, and what to do if you forget it</summary>

Printing the defaults here is what makes them a placeholder rather than a secret, which is why the
container warns about the password on every start until you change it.

The profile page asks for the current password as well as the new one, so an unattended tab cannot
be used to take over the instance. New credentials are stored on the data volume
(`/data/selfhost-auth.json`: a username, a salt and a hash, never the password) and take precedence
over the environment from then on — an `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD` set at `docker run` months ago cannot
quietly undo a password change. After one, the start-up line changes to say where the real password
came from:

```
[harnessrouter] sign in as 'harnessrouter' (credentials set from the profile page)
```

Saving also signs out every other browser. Yours stays signed in.

Forgot it? There is no reset email to send, so delete `/data/selfhost-auth.json` and restart. The
instance falls back to `HR_AUTH_USER` / `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD`.

</details>

### 5. Connect a model provider

**Nothing runs until you do this.** There is no bundled model, no trial key, and no free tier
hiding in the image.

Open **Integrations** and press **Add Integration**. It asks three things: a name, the provider,
and your API key.

![Adding a provider on the Integrations page](images/05-add-integration.png)

Which models that provider serves is not your problem to configure: the product keeps that list and
adds to it as providers ship models. Pick the provider, paste the key, and the models it covers
appear on the row.

<details>
<summary>Running more than one provider</summary>

The mappings underneath the integrations decide which one serves a given model. With a single
integration there is nothing to set.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Setting it from the environment instead, for a scripted deploy</summary>

A connection names a provider and its credential; a policy says which connection a backend uses.
Useful when the box is built by a script and nobody is going to open a browser:

```bash
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_CONN_ANTHROPIC='{"name":"anthropic","provider":"anthropic","api_key":"sk-ant-…"}'
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_POLICY_CLAUDE='{"chain":["anthropic"]}'
```

There is one policy variable per backend: `…POLICY_CLAUDE`, `…POLICY_CODEX`, `…POLICY_HERMES`. An
OpenAI-compatible endpoint of your own takes the same pair with a `base_url` added, and
`"provider":"openai"` rather than the `"openai-api"` that `.env.example` still shows:

```bash
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_CONN_LOCAL='{"name":"local","provider":"openai","api_key":"…","base_url":"https://api.example.com/v1"}'
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_POLICY_CODEX='{"chain":["local"]}'
```

Not every provider fits every backend, and a pairing that does not fit fails quietly: the turn
comes back empty after a long wait rather than erroring. The Integrations page does not have this
problem, because it only offers you providers that work.

| Connection `provider` | Backends that can use it |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | Claude Code, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `openai` | Codex, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `openrouter` | Codex, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `azure-foundry` | Codex, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `google` | Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Gemini CLI, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `bedrock` | Claude Code, Hermes |
| `tokenrouter` | Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Gemini CLI, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `vercel` | Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `llmtr` | Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |
| `custom` | Claude Code, Hermes, Pi, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cline, Oh My Pi, mini-SWE-agent |

</details>

<details>
<summary>What a backend with nothing connected says</summary>

Forthcoming about it, which is what you get if you skip this step entirely:

```json
{"error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","code":"invalid_input","message":"no provider configured for backend 'codex'. Add an integration for a provider that serves 'gpt-5.4-mini', or configure a connection policy"}}
```

</details>

### 6. Give it something to do

**Agent harnesses → pick a harness → New task.** Every harness lists its own tasks; a fresh
draft opens with the caret in the box. Choose a model on the chip under the message, and type.
The turn streams back as it happens: every command the agent runs, every file it touches, and
the answer at the end.

![A task: the request, the commands, the files it wrote, and the test result](images/task-run.png)

That is the whole install. State is SQLite and files on one Docker volume. Delete the volume and
the instance is gone; copy it and you have moved the instance, harnesses, transcripts and all.

<details>
<summary>What is happening in that screenshot</summary>

That one asked for a small utility with tests. The agent wrote it, built a fixture tree with
duplicates planted in it, ran the suite, and came back with `OK (3 tests passed)`, which is an answer
you can check rather than one you have to trust. Everything it produced is on the transcript to
take away, a file at a time or the lot as a zip.

</details>

---

## Starter kits

Starter kits are worked examples, and they are here to show you what this can be pointed at.

Each one is a whole agent product rather than a snippet: an app, an agent configured to drive it,
and the skill that teaches that agent the format it writes. Use one, then read it: every kit is
open source. More arrive over time; your instance lists the ones it has.

![The Starter Kits page, before any kit has been launched](images/dashboard-1-starter-kits.png)

Launching asks one question: what to run it on.

<details>
<summary>What the launch dialog is telling you</summary>

Each card names the base and the model it will run on before you launch it, so you can see what a
kit is about to spend before it spends it. What it names depends on the keys you gave it in step 5:
the screenshot above is an instance with three providers connected, and an instance with one will
recommend that one on every card.

The runtimes you have no key for are listed but disabled, with the reason on them:

> Hermes · `deepseek-v4-pro` · Not connected. Add a provider that serves this model to use it.

What the dialog recommends is a suggestion you can overrule, not a default you have to accept.

</details>

### Slides

A deck is one conversation. Ask for a presentation and the agent designs it: structure first, then
a style system, then slide by slide. Slides appear while it works, so when the shape is wrong you
can say so while there are two slides to change instead of twenty.

The deck below came from one sentence: *"A 5-slide deck explaining what a container image is, for
new engineers."*

![The Slides editor: the sentence at the top of the conversation, the run underneath it, and the deck it produced](images/kit-slides.png)

<details>
<summary>What you are looking at in the panel on the right</summary>

That is the run, not a progress bar. It settled the structure, built a style system, checked what
the canvas would accept, wrote the deck, then validated it, and it says so as it goes.

Nothing here is a picture of a slide: every element is a real object on the canvas, so you can drag
it, resize it, retype it, or ask for another pass in the same conversation.

</details>

### Sheets

Rows are your data. An agent column runs one of your harnesses on every row, with the columns to
its left as input, and the sheet fills itself cell by cell. Press Run and it fills in row order with
a live count and a Stop button, because a column of a thousand rows is a thing you should be able to
change your mind about.

This one opened with *"help me build a sheet, i wanna use this to map investors in silicon valley.
the goal is to provide this one to investors outside of SV the startups invested by investors based
SV."*

![The Sheets editor: the request at the top of the conversation, real investor rows, and an agent column's output on each one](images/kit-sheets.png)

<details>
<summary>How that sheet got built</summary>

From that sentence, the agent decided the columns, worked out which of them a person fills in and
which one an agent should, and wrote the per-row prompt itself. The rows came from a follow-up,
*"search some real data and from internet"*, and it went and found four real investors with their
firm's own profile pages rather than inventing plausible ones.

</details>

<details>
<summary>If the agent-column menu says you have no other agents</summary>

An agent column runs one of your *other* agents, and a sheet will not run itself. So on an instance
where Sheets is the only thing you have launched, the column menu has nothing to offer and says so:

> Choose an agent… · You have no other agents yet. Create one, then choose it here.

**Harnesses → Add Harness** is the fix: a base, a model, a name, and it is ready in seconds. The
picker then lists it with the model it runs on. If you add one while a sheet is open, reload the
sheet first, because the list is read when the page loads.

</details>

### Dashboards

Say what you want to understand and point it at a database. The agent reads your schema, writes a
query per question, picks the chart that answers it, and lays the panels out. Opening the dashboard
re-runs every query, so what you see is the database now, not a snapshot from whenever it was
built.

![Launching the Dashboards kit: what to run it on, and which database to read](images/dashboard-2-launch.png)

This is the one kit with setup, and it is two fields: the connection and the sample-rows switch.

![The Dashboards kit: both turns of the conversation on the right, and the live panels they produced](images/kit-dashboard.png)

<details>
<summary>How that dashboard got built, and why its numbers are worth trusting</summary>

It opened with *"Revenue by month and the top 5 countries by revenue, plus total paid revenue."*
Both turns of that conversation are in the panel on the right: the first built it, and the second,
*"Enrich the dashboard like this"* with a picture of the layout attached, is where the panels you
see came from.

There is nowhere in a dashboard to type a number. Every figure on that page is the result of a
query that ran when the page opened, which is the property that makes it worth trusting. Ask for a
change and it runs each query before it wires it into a panel, so a panel that renders is a panel
whose query works.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Connecting a database</summary>

Three things to know before you connect one.

**The container has to be able to reach it.** If your database is another container, put both on
the same user-defined network so the database's *name* resolves. Docker's default bridge has no
DNS, so on it only the container's IP works, and that IP changes:

```bash
docker network create hr-net
docker network connect hr-net my-postgres
docker run -d --name harnessrouter --network hr-net \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 -v harnessrouter:/data … harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

Then `my-postgres:5432` works as a host in the connection string. A database on the host machine
rather than in a container is reachable at `host.docker.internal` on Docker Desktop, or via
`--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` on Linux.

**Set `HR_SECRET_KEY`.** Connection strings are encrypted at rest under a key derived from it,
and without it the server refuses to store one rather than writing your production credential to
disk in plaintext:

```bash
-e HR_SECRET_KEY=a-long-random-passphrase
```

Keep it. Change it and the stored connections can no longer be decrypted, and you reconnect them.

**Use a read-only database account.** Every statement is checked and only `SELECT` is allowed,
non-`SELECT`, multiple statements and data-modifying CTEs are refused, and on PostgreSQL the
query additionally runs in a `READ ONLY` transaction. That check is a parser, and a parser is a
thing that can be wrong. An account that has been granted `SELECT` and nothing else is a second
defence that does not depend on ours being right:

```sql
CREATE USER dashboards WITH PASSWORD '…';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE shop TO dashboards;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO dashboards;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dashboards;
```

The connection string is resolved at the moment a query runs. The agent's sandbox never receives
it. It gets a tool that runs `SELECT`s, and neither does the browser.

**Sample rows** are a per-connection switch, on by default: the agent sees a few real rows per
table so it can tell a status column from a category one. Turn it off and it sees table and
column names and types and no values at all.
</details>

### Videos

Describe a film and get one back: it plans the shots, renders each, lays them out on a canvas you
can rearrange, and assembles them into a single video you can download. Clips render in the
background, so you keep working while they arrive.

![The Videos kit: the brief at the top of the conversation, every shot on the canvas, and the finished film above the timeline that assembled it](images/kit-video.png)

The conversation on the right is the whole job: what was asked for, what the agent found it could
actually generate and at what price, the storyboard it settled on, and what it wants you to check
before the film goes out. It costs what it says it costs, per clip, and it tells you before it
spends.

> [!WARNING]
> This is the one kit that spends real money per second of output rather than per turn, because
> every shot is a generation. Try it once you already know what the console is doing.

---

## What it is

An *agent harness* is the runtime layer around a model; Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes are harnesses. In this repo's API you also create *harness* objects: a saved configuration whose `base` is one of those runtimes, plus a model, instructions, and limits. A *task* is one run of that configuration, a real conversation against a real POSIX workspace with bash and git, streamed back as it happens.

HarnessRouter Community Edition implements UHP for both: an OpenAI **Responses-compatible** API for
running turns, harness CRUD, sessions, streaming, cancellation, and idempotency. The console is
a thin client over that API; anything the UI does, you can do from `curl`.

**The console is the hosted product's console.** Not a cut-down rebuild: the same pages, the
same components, the same API client. Surfaces that need a service a single box doesn't have,
such as accounts, billing, and marketplace, are simply not shown.

**Supported harnesses:** Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes, installed on first run rather than shipped
in the image, for the license reasons in step 3. Review each tool's terms before you use it.

**Bring your own key.** Your provider credentials are read from the environment at start-up and
handed to the agent directly. They are never written into the image, never committed, and never
sent anywhere but your provider.

## Why self-host

- **Your keys, your bills, your data.** Nothing leaves the box except calls to your model provider.
- **Real workspaces.** Agents get bash, git, and a filesystem, their native environment, not a
  sandbox emulation.
- **The same API as the hosted product.** Not a reduced fork: the same `/v1` surface, so anything
  you build against it keeps working if you later move to the hosted service.
- **Actually self-contained.** No control plane to phone home to, no managed database.

## The Unified Harness Protocol

This repository is both an implementation and a standard. The protocol the gateway speaks is
specified, versioned and testable in [`protocol/`](../protocol/), and documented at
[unifiedharnessprotocol.org](https://unifiedharnessprotocol.org):

| | |
|---|---|
| [Specification](../protocol/versions/2026-08-11/) | Ten normative chapters, version `2026-08-11` |
| [Machine-readable](../protocol/schema/) | OpenAPI 3.1 + JSON Schema 2020-12, generated from one source |
| [Conformance suite](../protocol/conformance/) | passing it is what "conformant" means, and what earns the right to the UHP name |
| [Governance](../protocol/GOVERNANCE.md) | How the standard changes, and the naming and conformance policy |

This edition is the reference implementation. The most recent published run
[passes at class Full](../protocol/conformance/reports/harnessrouter-ce-0.3.0.json), against 0.3.0.
**The standard can be implemented without HarnessRouter Cloud**: it is an HTTP contract, and
nothing in it requires a hosted service. Run the suite against your own server:

```bash
pip install -e protocol/conformance
uhp-conformance --base-url https://your-server --api-key "$KEY" --class full
```

## Configuration

<details>
<summary>Choosing backends, and building with a browser</summary>

Backends are installed into your data volume rather than baked into the image, so which ones you
want is a run-time setting:

```bash
docker run -e HR_BACKENDS=claude,codex,hermes,pi,dsh,opencode,qwen,gemini,cline,omp ...  # the default
docker run -e HR_BACKENDS=opencode ...                             # lean
```

A backend that fails to install is not fatal: the others still work, and the console offers what
the gateway's catalogue lists, so an unavailable backend simply is not shown.

Previously documented here: that any value leaving out `hermes` made the container exit
immediately with status 1. That no longer reproduces. Checked 2026-08-25 on a fresh volume with
`HR_BACKENDS=codex` (one of the values named) and with `HR_BACKENDS=opencode`: both reach a healthy
container with zero restarts and a gateway serving 200.

Chromium is genuinely an image layer, so it stays a build flag:

```bash
docker build -t harnessrouter --build-arg WITH_BROWSER=1 .
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>What the entrypoint sets for you</summary>

| Variable | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `HR_BACKING` | `local` | SQLite + files on `/data`. No external storage. |
| `HR_IDENTITY_MODE` | `off` | One box, one owner; an accounts system would be ceremony with nothing behind it. |
| `HR_CREDIT_GATE` | `off` | Metering is a hosted concern. |
| `POOL_MGMT_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:8081` | The runner is in this container. |
| `HR_POOL_AUTH` | `none` | No cloud identity to present to a loopback runner. |
| `HR_SANDBOX_TRUST` | `owner` | You own the box, the agent and the key, so the key is handed over directly rather than brokered. |
| `HARNESS_WORKSPACE` | `/data/workspaces` | One directory per session, on the volume, so a restart doesn't discard work in flight. |
| `HR_WORKSPACE_TTL_HOURS` | `72` | Idle session workspaces are removed after this. They rehydrate from their checkpoint, so this costs time, not work. `0` keeps them forever. |
| `HARNESS_INTERNAL_KEY` | generated | Per-container; never leaves the process tree. |

</details>

## Using the API

The console is optional: it is a thin client over the same API. On a default install that API is
reached through the console's own port, and **the login gate covers it too**, so a call needs the
session cookie. Sign in once and keep the cookie:

```bash
curl -s -c hr.cookies http://localhost:3000/api/selfhost/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"harnessrouter","password":"harnessrouter"}'   # your password, not the default
# {"ok":true}
```

Then run a turn. The gateway speaks the Responses API:

```bash
curl -s -b hr.cookies http://localhost:3000/api/harness/v1/responses \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":"Reply with exactly this and nothing else: it works.",
       "metadata":{"harness_id":"codex"},
       "model":"gpt-5.4-mini",
       "stream":false}'
```

```json
{"id":"resp_284e450bc2be4de8bea94c4af6030292","object":"response","created_at":1786822334,
 "status":"completed","error":null,"incomplete_details":null,"previous_response_id":null,
 "model":"gpt-5.4-mini",
 "output":[{"id":"msg_3d71e018c6584abbb063ee16d9a36e75","type":"message","status":"completed",
            "role":"assistant",
            "content":[{"type":"output_text","text":"it works.","annotations":[]}]}],
 "store":true,
 "usage":{"input_tokens":10878,"output_tokens":34,"total_tokens":10912},
 "metadata":{"session_id":"hsessa79756fab07a4bf58fa072be24d5ce59"}}
```

That turn is not a side channel: it appears in the console under **Tasks**, against the same
harness, with its full transcript. The console and the API are the same instance seen twice.

<summary>The rest of the surface</summary>

`harness_id` accepts one of the built-in ids the console shows on the Harnesses page: `codex`,
`claude-code`, `hermes`, or the id of a harness you created. Harness CRUD (`/v1/harnesses`), the
model catalog (`/v1/models`), sessions (`/v1/sessions/{id}/turns`, `/cancel`) and task listing
(`/v1/traces`) are all on the same prefix. Set `"stream":true` for server-sent events instead of
one response at the end.

If the box is one nobody else can reach, `HR_AUTH_DISABLED=1` removes the gate entirely and the
same calls work with no cookie at all.

## Putting it on a public URL

The console can create harnesses, read every task transcript, and run an agent with your
provider key.

For TLS, keep the console on loopback and put a terminating proxy in front. With Caddy that is
one file and a real certificate, automatically:

```caddyfile
console.example.com {
    encode zstd gzip
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000 {
        flush_interval -1      # agent turns stream for minutes; never buffer them
    }
}
```

The `flush_interval -1` matters: without it a proxy buffers the event stream and the console
looks frozen until the turn ends.

Pin the tag, and do not run `0.1.x` or `0.2.0`: they have no sign-in gate at all, so an instance
running them is open to anyone who can reach the port. `0.3.0` is the first release with one.

<details>
<summary>Why changing the password restarts the console</summary>

Changing it from **Profile** signs out every other browser and restarts the console. That restart
is what makes "signed out everywhere" true rather than merely displayed: the gate reads its
signing key once at start-up and cannot be told about a change in place. A task that is mid-turn
runs straight through it.

## Moving to the hosted service

When a harness is working the way you want, **Harnesses → Push to cloud** copies it into a
hosted HarnessRouter account with your hosted API key.

This is deliberately one-way. Local is where you iterate; once promoted, the hosted copy is the
source of truth. There is no "pull from cloud", so a harness can never be live in two places
each claiming to be current. Your hosted key is used for that one request and is never stored.

## Architecture

```
┌─ container ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  UI (Next.js)  :3000  ← the only published port         │
│      │ same-origin proxy                                │
│  Gateway       :8080  Responses API, harness CRUD       │
│      │ loopback                                         │
│  Runner        :8081  one agent CLI per session         │
└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
       /data (volume): SQLite, files, secrets, workspaces
```

The gateway and the runner listen on loopback inside the container and are not publishable; the
console's port is the way in, which is why the login gate ships inside the image rather than in
whatever proxy happens to sit in front.

Sessions run concurrently and are isolated: each gets its own workspace directory, its own
conversation state, and its own checkpoint. Turn concurrency defaults to the machine's core
count. This box cannot scale sandboxes on demand the way the hosted deployment does, so the
limit is what it can actually run.

Storage sits behind a small adapter interface for records, files, and secrets. This repo ships the
local implementations; the hosted deployment supplies its own against the same interface. That
seam is why this is genuinely the same codebase rather than a fork that drifts.
